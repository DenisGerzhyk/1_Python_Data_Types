1).
This code takes an input integer from the user, and then proceeds to extract each digit of the number separately by dividing it by 10 and using the modulo operator. The extracted digits are stored in separate variables, x1, x2, x3 and x4.

2).
This code takes an input integer from the user, and then uses the divmod function to extract each digit of the number separately. The divmod function returns a tuple with the quotient and remainder of the division operation. The first divmod operation extracts the first two digits of the number, the second divmod operation extracts the third digit, and the third divmod operation extracts the fourth digit. The extracted digits are stored in separate variables, x1, x2, x3 and x4.

Training
This code defines a function "foo" that takes an input parameter "a" and returns the quotient and remainder of "a" divided by -11 using the divmod function. It then takes an input integer from the user, and passes it as an argument to the foo function. The function returns the quotient and remainder of the input integer divided by -11, and prints the result.
